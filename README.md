## About the Course

Dart is a versatile language created by Google, widely used for building mobile, desktop, backend, and web applications. It is the primary language for Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

In this course, you will learn:
- The basic syntax and structure of Dart
- How to declare and use variables
- Different data types and their uses
- Performing arithmetic, relational, and logical operations
- Control flow mechanisms, including conditional statements and loops
- How to work with collections, such as lists and maps
- The use of the dot operator for accessing properties and methods
- Advanced topics like null safety, ensuring your code is robust and error-free
- Principles of object-oriented programming in Dart
- Asynchronous programming using Futures, Streams, and the async/await keywords
